# `ckb-sdk-address`

`@nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-address` is the address module of `@nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-core`.

Its current responsibility is just to generate an address object, the algorithm will be introduced in an RFC in the near future.

In a nutshell, the address format is similar to [BIP-0173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki)

1. this module takes a private key and then calculates the corresponding public key with secp256k1 algorithm;
2. use blake160 algorithm to hash the public key and get a blake160-ed string;
3. bech32 the blake160-ed string with three options(prefix, type, binIndex) to get a bech32-formatted address.

Detailed methods could be found in `@nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-utils`

## Address configuration

> The meanings of the configuration will be explained in the RFC.

1. Prefix

   - 'ckb' for the mainnet
   - 'ckt' for the testnet

2. type

   - '0x00' for wallet build-in binary_hash ref id
   - '0x01' for binary_hash

3. binIndex

   - 'P2PH'

## Address Value

The `address.value` is the address string generated by the private key and address configuration you passed to the constructor.

## Address identifier

The `address.identifier` represents the identity of the address object. It derives from the public key, and used to generate the human readable address value.

`address.identifier` is calculated by `blake160(publicKey)`, which picks the first 20 bytes of `blake2b(publicKey)`.

And `address.identifier` is used to generate `address.value` in `bech32(address.identifier, ...AddressConfiguration)`.

## Installation

Install the package with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
$ yarn add @nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-address
```

Or install the package with [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```sh
$ npm install --save @nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-address
```

## Usage

```javascript
const Address = require('@nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-address').default

const privateKey = 'your private key'

const address = new Address(privateKey, { prefix: 'ckt' })
console.log(address.value)
console.log(address.identifier)
```
